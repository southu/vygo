# Ratchet — one-pager

**Print tip:** For best results open [`one-pager-print`](./one-pager-print) and use **File → Print** (or Save as PDF). This Markdown page is the same content for editors that don’t open HTML.

## What it is

Self-hosted **AI build-and-verify control plane**. Human types a goal → system queues missions → AI **builder** pushes code → **deploy gate** waits for live `/version` SHA → AI **tester** grades the **live** site → repeat until a **streak** of passes. Name = contract: only moves forward.

## Stack (loopback)

| Piece        | Port / place              | Job                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Composer     | `:8377`                   | UI, queue, admin         |
| Lazy / Medic | `:8378`                   | Overnight watch / recovery |
| Vault        | `:8379`                   | Secrets + cloud broker   |
| Ratchet CLI  | `RATCHET_ROOT/harness`    | Loop orchestration       |
| Projects     | `RATCHET_ROOT/projects`   | `project.json` shells    |
| Edge         | TLS + basic auth (optional) | Public face only       |

## Non‑negotiables

1. **Live is truth** — tester hits `live_url`, not local tree
2. **`/version`** — product must return deployed git SHA (no basic auth on that path for the gate)
3. **Proof of work** — harness checks git; ignore agent claims
4. **Streak** — usually 2 consecutive PASSes
5. **No secrets in builder env** — Vault consumer only
6. **Composer restarts must not kill builders** — detached workers outlive Admin Apply
7. **Team git author** — bot authors may be blocked by Vercel etc.
8. **Multi-step goals** → about **4–8** queue items for real product work; bind cloud project UUIDs
9. **Vault arm persists** across consumer restart (still unlock after full DEK loss / reboot)

## Loop exits

| Code | Meaning               |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| 0    | Success (streak)      |
| 2    | Max iterations        |
| 3    | Deploy timeout        |
| 4    | Tester contract       |
| 5    | Builder proof-of-work |
| 6    | Budget                |

## Mental model

**Composer** = factory office · **Ratchet** = factory floor · **Vault** = key cabinet · **Lazy/Medic/Sentinel** = night watch · **Product `/version`** = time clock.

---

## Rebuild in one breath

Host + Claude/Grok CLIs → trees `RATCHET_ROOT/{control,harness,projects}` → process manager (workers survive restarts) → edge → Vault arm → mock loop → product with `/version` → tiny real mission → harden (Sentinel, Lazy, docs).
